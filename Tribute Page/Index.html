        <h3> Sayings of Swami Vivekananda </h3>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make you spiritual. There is no other
                teacher but your own soul.</li>
            <li>You cannot believe in God until you believe in yourself.</li>
            <li>All the powers in the universe are already ours. It is we who have put our hands before our eyes and cry
                that it is dark.</li>
            <li>Condemn none: if you can stretch out a helping hand, do so. If you cannot, fold your hands, bless your
                brothers, and let them go their own way.</li>
            <li>Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached.</li>
            <li>When an idea exclusively occupies the mind, it is transformed into an actual physical or mental state.
            </li>
            <li>Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true.</li>
            <li>External nature is only internal nature writ large.</li>
            <li>We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts
                live; they travel far.</li>
            <li>The world is the great gymnasium where we come to make ourselves strong.</li>
        </ul>
